WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net timer_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin timer_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell timer_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
