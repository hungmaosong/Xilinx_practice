2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks reset and clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks reset and switch[0] are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks switch[0]]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks switch[0] and clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks switch[0]] -to [get_clocks clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks switch[0] and reset are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks switch[0]] -to [get_clocks reset]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks reset and clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks reset and switch[0] are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks reset] -to [get_clocks switch[0]]

The clocks switch[0] and clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks switch[0]] -to [get_clocks clk]

TIMING-7#4 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks switch[0] and reset are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks switch[0]] -to [get_clocks reset]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT timer_reg[3]_LDC_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.038 ns between timer_reg[3]_LDC/G (clocked by switch[0]) and led_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.066 ns between timer_reg[3]_LDC/G (clocked by switch[0]) and led_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.547 ns between timer_reg[3]_LDC/G (clocked by switch[0]) and timer_reg[3]_P/D (clocked by clk).
